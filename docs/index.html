<p>We study how humans interact with code and design new ways to build software. I work at the intersection
of software engineering and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>Microtasks are short, self-contained unit of works, enabling large tasks to be completed quickly
through solid parallelism.
We designed and developed Crowd Microservices to explore the effects
of applying microtasking to software development.</p>

<h2 id="programming-strategies">Programming strategies</h2>
<p>Developers solve problems by applying programming strategies, describing sequences of steps to debug,
reuse, design, test, and understand code. Experienced developers work better by using more effective
strategies. We’ve been exploring ways to capture and make explicit the strategies developers use, helping
uncover how developers work differently and to create new ways to help developers benefit from the
hard-earned wisdom of experienced developers.</p>
